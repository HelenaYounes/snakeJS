// add visual effect when hit wall or bad apple
//add effect when earn bonus life, maybe a little eart on Lives div, tat turn into digit

//have apple jump when caught from canvas to score Div

//add menu dropdown, can change backgroud image, snake color,

//bonus apple disapears after timeout with div showing remaining time

// make curried function that makes a given property of a given object set to true/false

//partially applied function, like caught Apple/bonus
// or activate rotten/bonus like :
// activateItaem = fn => (...args) => {
// return fn(...args)
// }

// const activate =
// 	(fn) =>
// 	(...args) => {
// 		fn(...args);
// 	};

// function declaration are hoisted to the top, so you can invoke them before instantiiating them.
// unlike function expression that need to be declared before being invoked .

// closure and currying : kind of like wen create classless component, set up all varialbles and fucntion, they can access the higher level ones.
